## Okay, this is epic
After getting my credit card declined many times on the internet (probably due to my privacy settings), I finally made a basic website! I decided on using a VPS and nginx to host it. It's hosted on a Debian server in New York through Vultr ($3.50 a month), and I got my domain name from namecheap ($0.99 for the first year). 
I've also set up a personal git server, there's no interface as of now (looking at gitea), but now all my projects are proudly selfhosted online.
