<p>
We've finally proved Fermat's Little Theorem and explained some of the machinery behind groups and rings. Let's continue by defining an important function.
</p>
<p><b><u>Definition</u></b><em> (Euler's Totient Function):</em> Let $\varphi: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to \mathbb{Z}^+$ be defined as $\varphi(n) = $ the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+. \varphi$ is also known as the <b>Euler phi-function</b>.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, it can be quite hard to procure a general formula for $\varphi(n)$ for all $n$. However, in some cases it is relatively easy— for example, if $n$ is prime, then $\varphi(n)$ is simply $n-1.$ Recall from the last post that the Euler phi-function simply defines the <em>order</em> of the multiplicative group of units $\mathbb{Z}_n^*.$ We now state an important theorem:
</p>
<p><b><u>Theorem</u></b><em> (Euler's Theorem):</em> Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ be relatively prime to $n,$ that is, $\text{gcd}(a,n)=1.$ Then 
\[
a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, n),
\]
where $\varphi$ denotes the <em><b>Euler phi-function,</b></em> and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+.$
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> Euler's Theorem is equivalent to the following statement: For all $a \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$, $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1$ (mod $n$). We know from a previous theorem that any element of a finite group raised to the power of the order of the group is $1.$ Since $|\mathbb{Z}_n^*|=\varphi(n)$, we have 
\[
a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv a^{|\mathbb{Z}_n^*|} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, n). \quad \boxtimes
\]
</p>

<p>
Notice that the reasoning behind the proof is almost the exact same as the proof of Fermat's Little Theorem: <b>Indeed, Euler's Theorem is simply a <em>generalization</em> of Fermat's Little Theorem—</b> Fermat's Little Theorem simply describes the case where $n$ is prime.
</p>
<p>
Let's calculate $\varphi(n)$ for $n=pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two prime numbers. We want to find the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. First, note that the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ is $n-1,$ or $pq-1$. We want to subtract the number of integers that have a multiple in common with $n.$ This is what we have so far: 
\[
\varphi(n) = (pq - 1) - ? - ?
\]
 Since $n$ is composed of two prime numbers, this would entail the multiples of $p$ and $q$ (due to the unique factorization of $n$) that are less than $n$, since $n=pq$ is already accounted for. There are $p-1$ multiples of $q$ and $q-1$ multiples of $p$ that are less than or equal to $n$. This makes sense if you think about $n$ this way. Without loss of generality,
 \[
 n = pq = q + \cdots + q
 \]
 $p$ times. Then the distinct numbers
 \begin{align}
     &1:q \\
     &2:q + q \\
     &3:q + q + q \\
     & \vdots \\
     &p-1:q + \cdots + q 
 \end{align}
 are all multiples of $q$ that are less than $n$, hence why we stopped at the term $p-1$. Our goal is find the <em>number</em> of factors of $q$: then there must be $p-1$ factors since the set the set $\{1, 2, 3, \cdots p-1 \}$ has $p-1$ elements. A similar argument holds for the factors of $p$. We have some more information on how $\varphi(n)$ looks now...
 \begin{align}
     \varphi(n) &= (pq - 1) - (p - 1) - (q - 1) \\ 
                &= pq - p - q + 1 \\ 
                &= p(q-1)-(q-1) \\ 
                &= (p-1)(q-1).
 \end{align}
...Oh yeah, it's all coming together. 
</p>

<p>
Now we finally understand the reasoning behind choosing the seemingly arbitary number $(p-1)(q-1)$: it's the <em><b>order of the multiplicative group of integers mod $pq$</b></em>, which means <em><b>any element of $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$ will reduce to 1 if raised to the power of $(p-1)(q-1)$ modulo $(p-1)(q-1)$ by Euler's Theorem.</b></em> Let us finally prove that pesky lemma from the first post.
</p>
<p><b><u>Lemma:</u></b> Let $n=pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes. If $a$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$ and $w$ is an integer such that $w \equiv 1 \, \text{mod} \, (p-1)(q-1)$, then 
\[
a^w \equiv a \, (\text{mod} \,n).
\]
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> Since $w \equiv 1 \, \text{mod} \,(p-1)(q-1), w = k(p-1)(q-1)+1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. So
\begin{align}
    a^w &= a^{k(p-1)(q-1)+1} \\
        &= a^{(p-1)(q-1)^k}a \\
        &= a(a^{\varphi(n)})^k \\ 
        &\equiv a(1)^k \ \small{\text{by Euler's Theorem}} \\
        &= a \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\end{align}
</p>

<p>
With that, we've finally finished the theory behind RSA Encryption. Let's end this series with a real-world application, follow along on your Linux machines everyone! (Disclaimer: This should work on any machine with GPG installed).
</p>

<p>
We can use RSA Encryption to digitally sign messages, that is, generate a signature that anybody with my public key can decrypt, but only I can encrypt. Go ahead and <a href="https://gnupg.org/download" target="_blank">grab yourself of a copy of GnuPG</a>, the program we're going to use to create keys and verify signatures. If you're on Linux, just run 

<pre>
<code>sudo pacman -S gnupg</code>
</pre>

or some variant (if you're using Linux, I hope you know how to install packages).
</p>

<p>
We'll use the same notation as the original post, refer back to it if you need to. Go ahead and download <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/examples/hello_world.txt">the message we're going to be verifiying</a> and <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/examples/hello_world.sig">the digital signature generated by RSA Encryption.</a> 
</p>

<p>
The algorithm starts by encoding $m$ (hello_world.txt) as an integer. We generate the digital signature by using my <em><b>private key</b></em> and letting the singature equal 
\[
m^s \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
The resultant signature is encoded in the file hello_world.sig above. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to generate a GPG key pair and sign a file of your own, go ahead and open your terminal emulator (Powershell for Windows) and run 
<pre>
<code>gpg --gen-key</code>
</pre>
and follow the instructions. To generate the digital signature for a file, run 
<pre>
<code>gpg --output file.sig --detach-sig file</code>
</pre>
and replace <code>file.sig</code> with whatever name you want your signature file to be, and <code>file</code> with the file you want to sign. 
</p>

<p>
Now since I used my <em><b>private key</b></em> to sign this file, you'll need my <em><b>public key</b></em> to verify the signature. How this works is by raising the signature to the power of $r$ (which is in the public key) to yield 
\[
m^{s^r} \equiv m^{(rs)} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n)
\]
by our lemma. Isn't that neat? Basically, it compares both the message $m$ and the signature raised to the power of $r$ (denoted $m^{s^r}$) and checks if the two match— if they do then great, if they don't, then the signature has been compromised/the message has been tampered with since it was sent, and should not be trusted.
</p>

<p>
To follow along on your own machine, <code>cd</code> to the directory you downloaded the files in and run
<pre>
<code>gpg --verify hello_world.sig hello_world.txt</code>
</pre>
And that's a wrap! If you want to send me encrypted emails, <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/examples/simonspublickey.gpg">here's my public key.</a> Together, we can use the power of math and encryption to protect our content from the peering eyes of the NSA!
