I mentioned in my introduction post that this series would probably end up being about the applications of Linear Algebra to other fields of math or something. Well it's the first post, and we already stopped talking about applications! Whoops. Today let's talk about the derivative as a linear transformation, I'll assume that you know everything from a first-semester Linear Algebra course.

Consider the vector space with basis set 
\[
\mathscr{B} = \{ 1, x, x^2, ... , x^n \}
\]
over the field $\mathbb{R}.$ This is known as the <b>vector space of polynomials with real coefficients of degree n or less</b>, denoted by $\mathbb{R}[n]$. If it looks familiar, it probably showed up as a frequent example in your Linear Algebra problem sets (and is of extreme importance over an arbitrary field in Galois Theory)!
