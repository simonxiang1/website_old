Running log posts are not actually about running, and today's running log is about swimming. I've got one leg of the triathlon down (running), and <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/blog/bike">started working on the other</a>. However, I rarely swim, and even when I do, I do not enjoy it. I want to change that, so I decided to (voluntarily) hop in the pool for the first time in forever.
</p>

<p>
Usually while swimming I'm too busy focusing on how much I'm suffering to reflect on my thoughts, but since today was a voluntary expidition, I was able to gather my observations and focus on my surroundings more, like how I do when I run.

Swimming is inherently a brutal sport. Man isn't built for the water, and being in a pool is like being surrounded by a foreign substance on all sides. Looking around underwater in the deep end, you see a huge expanse of emptiness, with mannequin-like figures comically floating at the top. You are one of them, of course. When I run, sometimes I feel insignifant before a long stretch of nature, earth lining your path all the way to the sun. I can imagine cyclists having the same feeling, but I never thought I would feel that way in the middle of a tiny commercial pool.

<p>
There's a book I quite like called "<em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em>", which I've somewhat <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/blog/running-log-in-each-shave-lies-a-philosophy">written about before.</a> Murakami often talks about a deep, dark, place, one where he retreats to to get his most serious writing done. In a sense, swimming through a pool feels like going through the tunnel: you're a tiny, insignificant figure surrounded by a foreign substance on all sides, trudging your way through to reach a goal. In the pool is silence, besides the ambient aquatic noises and the rhythmic 1-2-3 breathing pattern. The walls offer you an escape to reality, with awful Christmas songs and small chatter, like rungs on a ladder. But I didn't rest during my swim, so it was an immersive experience. 
</p>
<p>
On a side note, I've been trying to do more physical activies without breaks, like Murakami. I think his reasoning is pretty solid: if you paid to get into a race, you paid to run, why walk? In the same vein, I showed up to the pool to swim, why should I keep hanging on the ledge?
