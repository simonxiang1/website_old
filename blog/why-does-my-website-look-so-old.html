<h1>Why does my website look so old?</h1>

<p>Here are some reasons why.</p>

<h3>The web is bloated</h3>

<p><strong>In a world of overdesigning and excessive emphasis on the graphical user experience, the internet has become massively bloated.</strong> How many times have you loaded up a website for it to look like <a href="pictures/bloated_wire.jpg" target="_blank">this?</a> <a href="http://everyfuckingwebsite.com" target="_blank">Or what about this?</a> (I don't condone swearing by the way).</p>

<p> Either way, "modern" websites have become an abomination. The original premise that websites should be distributed, accessible, and convey information effectively has been abandoned in favor of advertisements, bloat, and rampant censorship. 
</p>

<h3> Self-sufficiency on the Internet</h3>

<p>When I set out to create this website, I had two goals, the first of which was <strong>self-sufficiency.</strong> I own the VPS this is hosted on and set up the SSL certificate/nginx myself (with the help of some open source software). I write blog posts in HTML and upload them without the help of a static site generator. 
</p>

<p>Sure, I gain some functionality and save some time if I host my site with GitHub or use WordPress as a backend for my blog. <em>However, that comes at the cost of full control over <strong>my</strong> website</em>. The miniscule time and cost investment is a small price to pay for <strong>actually owning your own things</strong> (doesn't that sound ridiculous? Most people don't online).
</p>

<h3> Less is more </h3>

<p>My second goal was a design goal: KISS, or, <b>K</b>eep <b>I</b>t <b>S</b>imple, <b>S</b>my friend. I'm a minimalist. I don't like owning branded T-shirts or physical papers. I don't even own a mouse! It doesn't make sense for me to over-engineer a simple static text-based website. I only load what I need, and I don't abuse Javascript like Google (see: Google Docs protected mode. How does even exist??).
</p>

<p>If you're curious, <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1/simonxiang.xyz">check out the source code</a>— of course, open source is essential for digital freedom. In terms of design, I took inspiration from <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">these</a> <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">three</a> <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">websites</a> (once again, I don't condone swearing). There's one more reason left as to why my website looks like this...

<h3> The final reason </h3>
<p>
I'm lazy and not very good at HTML/CSS. Plus, it looks like your <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/">average math professor's website</a>. I think I have Stockholm syndrome— the plain HTML aesthetic has grown on me quite a bit. Also, it helps that Linux distributions default to a nice aesthetic font like <a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/">DejaVu</a> as opposed to whatever abomination I saw when I loaded my website on Windows. This is next-level "it works on my machine" right here. </p>
