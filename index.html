<p><br/>Welcome to my personal website! I'm a rising freshman at <span style="color: #eb6100">UT Austin</span> and aspiring mathematician. (Only two of the above links have been set up.)

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> I like many things, including proofs, linux, and owning less thingsâ€” if I like something, I'll probably write about it on my blog at some point. Here are some posts that I recommend reading first:</p>
    <li><a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/blog/why-does-my-website-look-so-old.html" target="_blank">Why does this website look so old?</a></li>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
    <p> On the left is my  dog, Silver. Isn't she such a rebel? </p>
</div>

<p> I host my own git server <a href="https://git.simonxiang.xyz">here</a>, however, you can also find my repositories on <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I'm currently working on hosting my own Searx instance (private metasearch engine) and mail server here at simonxiang.xyz. </p>

<footer>Note: This site uses Javascript, sorry. I only use it for MathJax because image based solutions for web-based LaTeX are a huge hassle and are really ugly. I never log usage statistics for my server or track users because it's a huge pain and doesn't do anyone any good. You can easily <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1/website" target="_blank">check the source code</a> to verify that this website respects your freedoms, which is left as an exercise to the reader. </footer>
