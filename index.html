<h1>Simon Xiang</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website! I'm a rising freshman at UT Austin and aspiring mathematician. You can contact me here:
    <br/> 
    <br/>simonxiang@zohomail.com (personal mail, subject to change)
    <br/>simonxiang@utexas.edu
</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> I like many things, including proofs, linux, and owning less things- if I like something, I'll probably write about it on my blog at some point. Here are some "about me" posts that I recommend reading first: (will add soon) </p>
    <p> On the left is my dog, Silver. Isn't she such a rebel? </p>
</div>

<p> I also host my own git server here at git.simonxiang.xyz, unfortunately, I haven't set up a web interface for it yet. However, you can find my repositories on <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1">GitHub</a>. I'm currently working on also hosting my own Searx instance (private metasearch engine) and mail server here at simonxiang.xyz. </p>

<footer><br/>Note: This site uses Javascript, sorry. I only use it for MathJax because image based solutions for web-based LaTeX are a huge hassle and are really ugly. I never log usage statistics for my server or track users because it's a huge pain and doesn't do anyone any good. You can easily check the source code to verify that this website respects your freedoms, which is left as an exercise to the reader. </footer>
