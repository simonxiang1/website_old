<p><br/>Welcome to my personal website! I'm a rising freshman at UT Austin and aspiring mathematician. (None of the above links have been set up yet.)

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> I like many things, including proofs, linux, and owning less things- if I like something, I'll probably write about it on my blog at some point. Here are some "about me" posts that I recommend reading first: (will add soon) </p>
    <p> On the left is my dog, Silver. Isn't she such a rebel? </p>
</div>

<p> I also host my own git server here at git.simonxiang.xyz, unfortunately, I haven't set up a web interface for it yet. However, you can find my repositories on <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1">GitHub</a>. I'm currently working on also hosting my own Searx instance (private metasearch engine) and mail server here at simonxiang.xyz. </p>

<footer><br/>Note: This site uses Javascript, sorry. I only use it for MathJax because image based solutions for web-based LaTeX are a huge hassle and are really ugly. I never log usage statistics for my server or track users because it's a huge pain and doesn't do anyone any good. You can easily <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1/simonxiang.xyz">check the source code</a> to verify that this website respects your freedoms, which is left as an exercise to the reader. </footer>
