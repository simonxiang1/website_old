<p><br/>Welcome to my personal website! I'm a rising freshman at <span style="color: #eb6100">UT Austin</span> and aspiring mathematician. (One of the above links hasn't been set up yet.)

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> I like many things, including proofs, linux, and owning less thingsâ€” if I like something, I'll probably write about it on my blog at some point. Here are some posts that I recommend reading first:</p>
    <li><a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/blog/why-does-my-website-look-so-old" target="_blank">Why does this website look so old?</a></li>
</div>

<p> I host my own git server <a href="https://git.simonxiang.xyz" target="_blank">here</a>, however, you can also find my repositories on <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I also host my own instance of <a href="https://searx.simonxiang.xyz" target="_blank">Searx</a> here, which is an open-source meta-search engine that aggregates and anonymizes your search queries, which prevents search engines from profiling you. Since it's hosted on my server, it doesn't stop <em>me</em> from logging all your data though. You just have to trust me on this one. (Just kidding, see the footnote). I'm also currently working on hosting my own mail server here as well. </p>

<footer>Note: This site uses Javascript, sorry. I only use it for MathJax because image based solutions for web-based LaTeX are a huge hassle and are really ugly. I never track people or log usage statistics for anything on my server because it's a huge pain and doesn't do anyone any good. You can easily <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1/website" target="_blank">check the source code</a> to verify that this website respects your freedoms, which is left as an exercise to the reader. </footer>
