<p>
I'm really sad. I had a vision for a completely bloat-free website, but now I'm being plagued by the blight that is Javascript because I wanted pretty equations. Every single time someone loads my rolling blog page, it sends 40 something calls to the external MathJax server to generate the LaTeX equations, slowing down the load time by one or two seconds. Unacceptable! I want my stuff to load instantly all the time.
</p>

<p>
I've tried to host an instance of MathJax on my server before, but that means installing a bunch of bloat like Node.js on the server end. Plus, I'm not even sure it'll improve response times by that much. Image based solutions look absolutely horrible. Is there any clean solution to writing pretty equations in HTML? If anybody knows of one, please let a poor and struggling mathematician know.
</p>

<p>
Edit: An additional grievance: <code>\overbrace</code> and <code>\underbrace</code> will break MathJax. It doesn't even compile the rest of your document if you have one of these bad boys in your code! Someone please save me.

<h2 id='proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-3-digital-signatures-and-eulers-totient-function'>Proving RSA Encryption: An Application of Group Theory (Part 3: Digital Signatures and Euler's Totient Function)</h2>
<small>[<a href='#proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-3-digital-signatures-and-eulers-totient-function'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-3-digital-signatures-and-eulers-totient-function.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
We've finally proved Fermat's Little Theorem and explained some of the machinery behind groups and rings. Let's continue by defining an important function.
</p>
<p><b><u>Definition</u></b><em> (Euler's Totient Function):</em> Let $\varphi: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to \mathbb{Z}^+$ be defined as $\varphi(n) = $ the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+. \varphi$ is also known as the <b>Euler phi-function</b>.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, it can be quite hard to procure a general formula for $\varphi(n)$ for all $n$. However, in some cases it is relatively easy— for example, if $n$ is prime, then $\varphi(n)$ is simply $n-1.$ Recall from the last post that the Euler phi-function simply defines the <em>order</em> of the multiplicative group of units $\mathbb{Z}_n^*.$ We now state an important theorem:
</p>
<p><b><u>Theorem</u></b><em> (Euler's Theorem):</em> Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ be relatively prime to $n,$ that is, $\text{gcd}(a,n)=1.$ Then 
\[
a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, n),
\]
where $\varphi$ denotes the <em><b>Euler phi-function,</b></em> and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+.$
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> Euler's Theorem is equivalent to the following statement: For all $a \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$, $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1$ (mod $n$). We know from a previous theorem that any element of a finite group raised to the power of the order of the group is $1.$ Since $|\mathbb{Z}_n^*|=\varphi(n)$, we have 
\[
a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv a^{|\mathbb{Z}_n^*|} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, n). \quad \boxtimes
\]
</p>

<p>
Notice that the reasoning behind the proof is almost the exact same as the proof of Fermat's Little Theorem: <b>Indeed, Euler's Theorem is simply a <em>generalization</em> of Fermat's Little Theorem—</b> Fermat's Little Theorem simply describes the case where $n$ is prime.
</p>
<p>
Let's calculate $\varphi(n)$ for $n=pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two prime numbers. We want to find the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. First, note that the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ is $n-1,$ or $pq-1$. We want to subtract the number of integers that have a multiple in common with $n.$ This is what we have so far: 
\[
\varphi(n) = (pq - 1) - ? - ?
\]
 Since $n$ is composed of two prime numbers, this would entail the multiples of $p$ and $q$ (due to the unique factorization of $n$) that are less than $n$, since $n=pq$ is already accounted for. There are $p-1$ multiples of $q$ and $q-1$ multiples of $p$ that are less than or equal to $n$. This makes sense if you think about $n$ this way. Without loss of generality,
 \[
 n = pq = q + \cdots + q
 \]
 $p$ times. Then the distinct numbers
 \begin{align}
     &1:q \\
     &2:q + q \\
     &3:q + q + q \\
     & \vdots \\
     &p-1:q + \cdots + q 
 \end{align}
 are all multiples of $q$ that are less than $n$, hence why we stopped at the term $p-1$. Our goal is find the <em>number</em> of factors of $q$: then there must be $p-1$ factors since the set the set $\{1, 2, 3, \cdots p-1 \}$ has $p-1$ elements. A similar argument holds for the factors of $p$. We have some more information on how $\varphi(n)$ looks now...
 \begin{align}
     \varphi(n) &= (pq - 1) - (p - 1) - (q - 1) \\ 
                &= pq - p - q + 1 \\ 
                &= p(q-1)-(q-1) \\ 
                &= (p-1)(q-1).
 \end{align}
...Oh yeah, it's all coming together. 
</p>

<p>
Now we finally understand the reasoning behind choosing the seemingly arbitary number $(p-1)(q-1)$: it's the <em><b>order of the multiplicative group of integers mod $pq$</b></em>, which means <em><b>any element of $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$ will reduce to 1 if raised to the power of $(p-1)(q-1)$ modulo $(p-1)(q-1)$ by Euler's Theorem.</b></em> Let us finally prove that pesky lemma from the first post.
</p>
<p><b><u>Lemma:</u></b> Let $n=pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes. If $a$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$ and $w$ is an integer such that $w \equiv 1 \, \text{mod} \, (p-1)(q-1)$, then 
\[
a^w \equiv a \, (\text{mod} \,n).
\]
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> Since $w \equiv 1 \, \text{mod} \,(p-1)(q-1), w = k(p-1)(q-1)+1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. So
\begin{align}
    a^w &= a^{k(p-1)(q-1)+1} \\
        &= a^{(p-1)(q-1)^k}a \\
        &= a(a^{\varphi(n)})^k \\ 
        &\equiv a(1)^k \ \small{\text{by Euler's Theorem}} \\
        &= a \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\end{align}
</p>

<p>
With that, we've finally finished the theory behind RSA Encryption. Let's end this series with a real-world application, follow along on your Linux machines everyone! (Disclaimer: This should work on any machine with GPG installed).
</p>

<p>
We can use RSA Encryption to digitally sign messages, that is, generate a signature that anybody with my public key can decrypt, but only I can encrypt. Go ahead and <a href="https://gnupg.org/download" target="_blank">grab yourself of a copy of GnuPG</a>, the program we're going to use to create keys and verify signatures. If you're on Linux, just run 

<pre>
<code>sudo pacman -S gnupg</code>
</pre>

or some variant (if you're using Linux, I hope you know how to install packages).
</p>

<p>
We'll use the same notation as the original post, refer back to it if you need to. Go ahead and download <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/examples/hello_world.txt">the message we're going to be verifiying</a> and <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/examples/hello_world.sig">the digital signature generated by RSA Encryption.</a> 
</p>

<p>
The algorithm starts by encoding $m$ (hello_world.txt) as an integer. We generate the digital signature by using my <em><b>private key</b></em> and letting the singature equal 
\[
m^s \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
The resultant signature is encoded in the file hello_world.sig above. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to generate a GPG key pair and sign a file of your own, go ahead and open your terminal emulator (Powershell for Windows) and run 
<pre>
<code>gpg --gen-key</code>
</pre>
and follow the instructions. To generate the digital signature for a file, run 
<pre>
<code>gpg --output file.sig --detach-sig file</code>
</pre>
and replace <code>file.sig</code> with whatever name you want your signature file to be, and <code>file</code> with the file you want to sign. 
</p>

<p>
Now since I used my <em><b>private key</b></em> to sign this file, you'll need my <em><b>public key</b></em> to verify the signature. How this works is by raising the signature to the power of $r$ (which is in the public key) to yield 
\[
m^{s^r} \equiv m^{(rs)} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n)
\]
by our lemma. Isn't that neat? Basically, it compares both the message $m$ and the signature raised to the power of $r$ (denoted $m^{s^r}$) and checks if the two match— if they do then great, if they don't, then the signature has been compromised/the message has been tampered with since it was sent, and should not be trusted.
</p>

<p>
To follow along on your own machine, <code>cd</code> to the directory you downloaded the files in and run
<pre>
<code>gpg --verify hello_world.sig hello_world.txt</code>
</pre>
And that's a wrap! If you want to send me encrypted emails, <a href="https://simonxiang.xyz/examples/simonspublickey.gpg">here's my public key.</a> Together, we can use the power of math and encryption to protect our content from the peering eyes of the NSA!

<small>[<a href='#proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-2-fermats-little-theorem-and-ring-theory'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-2-fermats-little-theorem-and-ring-theory.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
This post is going to be a little heavy on the group theory— I'm going to try to build everything from the ground up but having a prior understanding of the basics of groups will be very useful. Let's start by stating an important theorem:
</p>
<p><b><u>Theorem</u></b><em> (Fermat's Little Theorem):</em> Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, $p$ a prime. If $p$ doesn't divide $a$, then $p$ divides $a^{p-1} - 1$, that is, 
\[
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, p).
\]
Those with a background in number theory may be more familiar with this equivalent statement of the theorem: If $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $a^p \equiv a \, (\text{mod} \, p)$ for $p$ a prime.
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b><em> I have discovered a truly remarkable proof that is too large to be contained in the margins of this post.</em> 
</p>

<p>
Just kidding. Before we prove Fermat's Little Theorem, let's talk about groups and fields. Here's how groups are defined (I'm going to let addition denote an arbitrary binary operation):
</p>
<p><b><u>Definition:</u></b> A <b><em>group</em></b> $\langle G,+ \rangle$ is a set $G$ closed under addition such that 
<li>&emsp; $\mathscr{G}_1$ (Associativity): For all $a, b, c \in G,$ 
\[
(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)
\]
</li>
<li>$&emsp; \mathscr{G}_2$ (Identity): There exists an element $0 \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$, 
\[
0+a=a+0=a.
\]
</li>
<li>$&emsp; \mathscr{G}_3$ (Inverse): For all $a \in G$, there exists an $a' \in G$ such that 
\[
a + a' = a' + a = 0.
\]
</li>
</p>

<p>
The cool thing about groups is that they're very simple yet powerful: as long as <em><b>any set</b></em> paired with <em><b>any binary operation</b></em> satisfies these axioms, it forms a group, and all the theorems from group theory apply to it. It doesn't just have to be $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard addition, anything from the set of square matrices $(GL(n, \mathbb{C}))$ to the set of permutations on a regular $n$-gon $(S_n)$ form a group.
</p>

<p>
Let's prove a theorem that will come in handy later. Since this post is going to be very technical, I'm not going to explain the proof since I'll have to explain everything that builds onto the main theorem used in the proof, Lagrange's Theorem.
</p>

<p><b><u>Theorem:</u></b> Let $G$ be a finite group under multiplication (so 1 is now the identity), and let $|G|$ denote its cardinality (order). Then for all $a \in G$, 
\[
a^{|G|} = 1.
\]
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> By <em>Lagrange's Theorem</em>, the order of the element $a$ (the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $a^k=1$) must divide $|G|$, that is, $|G|=kn$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then 
\[
a^{|G|}=a^{kn}=(a^k)^n=1^n=1. \quad \boxtimes
\]

</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at the specific group $\mathbb{Z}_p$, consisting of the set of integers 
\[
\{0,1,2, ... , p-1\}
\]
for $p$ a prime, paired with the binary operation of modular arithmetic. For example, $5+6$ (mod 7) $\equiv 11$ (mod 7) $\equiv 4$. I'll leave it to you to check that this forms a group. We can actually go further: we can tack on a second binary operation (modular multiplication) and call it a <em><b>ring</b></em>. 
</p>

<p>
Rings have many properties, but the important ones are that multiplication is associative, follows the distributive law ($a*(b+c) = a*b + a*c$), and that the ring has an identity for multiplication (there exists an element $1 \in R$ such that $1*a=a*1=a$ for all $a \in R$). Formally, a ring that has an identity element is called a <em>ring with unity</em>.
</p>

<p>
The thing about rings is that <em>not every element has a multiplicative inverse</em> like groups do. For example, take the element $0$. Since $0+0=0$, $a*0=a*(0+0)=a*0+a*0$ for all $a \in R$. If $a*0=a*0+a*0$, just add the additive inverse of $a*0$ to both sides of the equation to yield $0=a*0+0=a*0$. So $a*0 = 0$ for all $a \in R$. Now if $0$ had a multiplicative inverse, that's saying that there exists some element $0' \in R$ such that $0'*0=1$, which is a contradiction since we would have both $0'*0=0$ and $0'*0=1$. Therefore $0$ cannot have a multiplicative inverse.
</p>

<p>
Elements of ring that <em>do</em> have multiplicative inverses are called <em><b>units</b></em>. We have another handy theorem that lets us classify the units in $\mathbb{Z}_p$! However, I'm going to skip explaning the machinery behind the proof for the same reasons as the first proof.
</p>
<p><b><u>Theorem:</u></b> Let $n$ be the order of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $m \in \mathbb{Z}_n$. Then if $\text{gcd}(m,n)=1, m$ is a  <em><b>unit</b></em>.  
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> Since $\text{gcd}(m,n)=1$, for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $an+bm=1$ by <em>Bezout's Identity.</em> By the <em>Division Algorithm</em>, we know there exist integers $q$ and $r$ such that $0 \leq r \leq n-1$ and $b=nq+r$. Then 
\[
rm = (b-nq)m = bm-nqm = (1-an)-nqm = 1 - n(a+qm).
\]
Since we live in the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$, multiplication is commutative and multiples of $n$ will reduce to $0$ (mod $n$). Therefore $n(a+qm) \equiv 0 $ (mod $n$), and $rm=mr=1$. Since we have found a multiplicative inverse for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, we conclude that $m$ is a unit. $\quad \boxtimes$
</p>

<p>
There are special rings in which <b>every non-zero element is a ring</b> called <em><b>fields</b></em>. Intuively, fields are algebraic structures in which <em>division </em> is legal, since every element is a unit and therefore will remain in the field if "divided by" (multiplied by the multiplicative inverse) of another element in the field. From the previous theorem, the wonderful fact that $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field for $p$ a prime follows! Notice that every non-zero element of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is relatively prime to $p$ (that is, gcd$(m,p)=1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_p$) since $p$ is a prime number, so every non-zero element of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a unit, hence $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field.
</p>

<p>
Algebra is all about analyzing <em>structure</em>. Like a phoenix rising from its ashes, a group emerges from this field. We claim that the <em><b>set of units in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ form a group</b></em> for $p$ a prime. The hardest part about showing that this is a group <b>has already been done!</b> That is, showing that every element has an inverse, which is trivial since every element is a unit.
</p>

<p>
<strong>We are ready to prove Fermat's Little Theorem</strong>. Before we do, note that $p$ doesn't necessarily have to be prime for the set of units in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ to from a group. However, since $p$ is prime, we know that every non-zero element is a unit, and therefore we can easily classify this group as consisting of the elements 
\[
\{1,2,3, ... ,p-1\}
\]
and having order $p-1$. Let's denote our new group as $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$. For convenience, we'll restate Fermat's Little Theorem.
</p>
<p><b><u>Theorem</u></b><em> (The Little Theorem of Fermat):</em> Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, $p$ a prime. If $p$ doesn't divide $a$, then $p$ divides $a^{p-1} - 1$, that is, 
\[
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, p).
\]
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> We can restate Fermat's Little Theorem as such: For all $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$, $a^{p-1} \equiv 1$ (mod $p$). Recall a previous theorem: <em>If $G$ is a finite group under multiplication, then $a^{|G|}=1$ for all $a \in G$.</em> Clearly $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ is a finite group under multiplication, and the order of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ is $p-1$, that is, $|\mathbb{Z}_p^*|=p-1$. Therefore, for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$,
\[
a^{p-1} \equiv a^{|\mathbb{Z}_p^*|} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, p). \quad \boxtimes
\]
</p>

<p>
(For the curious reader: Here is the reasoning behind why the two statements of FLT are equivalent. Every integer will correspond to a coset of the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}.$ In other words, if $b \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $b \in a+p\mathbb{Z}$ for some $0 \lt a \leq p-1$ $(a \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}),$ which implies $a+p\mathbb{Z}=b+p\mathbb{Z}$ by the definition of cosets. So we can restate FLT as such: $\forall b+p\mathbb{Z}, (b+p\mathbb{Z})^{p-1} \equiv 1$ (mod $p$) which implies $\forall a+p\mathbb{Z}, (a+p\mathbb{Z})^{p-1} \equiv 1$ (mod $p$). Since $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are naturally isomorphic as rings (similarily, $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}^*$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ as groups), this statement is the same as $\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}_p, a^{p-1} \equiv 1$ (mod $p$). Therefore, FLT is equivalent to the alternate statement.) 
</p>

<p>
Once again, this post has grown quite long. I'll wrap this series up in the next post, look forward to it!

<h2 id='proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-1-asymmetric-encryption'>Proving RSA Encryption: An Application of Group Theory (Part 1: Asymmetric Encryption)</h2>
<small>[<a href='#proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-1-asymmetric-encryption'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-1-asymmetric-encryption.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
If someone receives an email from me, they might notice a peculiar "signature.asc" file attached at the bottom. This is not a bug— this is so the recipient can decrypt this file with the <b>RSA encryption algorithm</b> and verify that the sender is in fact, me, and the message has not been tampered with.
</p>

<p>
In essence, how the RSA algorithm works is by multiplying two very large prime numbers, known only to the recipient of the message, and making the product public (this is known as a <b><em>public key</em></b>). The sender uses the product to encrypt a message using an algorithm that only someone with knowledge of the two prime numbers (known as the <b><em>private key</em></b>) can decrypt. We can leave the question of the computational difficulty of integer factorization, i.e., whether or not there exists an algorithm that factors large prime numbers in polynomial time, to the computer scientists (hopefully there isn't, or else a large portion of modern day encryption becomes useless). 
</p>

<p>
What we're concerned with, as mathematicians, is the <b>validity</b> of the algorithm. We want to know, given <b><em>any</em></b> message, will the recipient <b><em>always</em></b> be able to decrypt the encrypted message with their private key and get the right message? Let's get right into the math— all you'll need to be familiar with is some basic number theory.
</p>

<p><b><u>Definition:</u></b> Let $n$ be the product of two prime numbers $p$ and $q$ respectively, and $s$ be an integer relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$. Let $p, q,$ and $s$ be part of the <em><b>private key</b></em>, and let $n$ and $r$ be part of the <em><b>public key</b></em>, where $r$ is the <em>multiplicative inverse</em> of $s$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$. That is, $rs \equiv 1$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$.  
</p>

<p>
The definitions may seem a little strange and arbitrary— no worries! Everything will fall into place over time. For now, our goal is to show that, using the public and private keys, the sender and recipient can <em>successfully complete an <b>encryption/decryption exchange</b></em>. Let's define what that is real quick: in this case, let $m$ be the message being encrypted (Note that $m$ is an integer— there are several ways to encode messages as integers that we will not cover here for the sake of brevity).       
</p>

<p><b>Encryption:</b> Let $e$ equal the encrypted message, which is determined by 
\[
e \equiv m^r \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
This is simple since $n$ and $r$ are known, and a computer can easily perform modular exponentiation in polynomial time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Decryption:</b> After receiving the encrypted message $e$, we decrypt it by computing 
\[
e^s \equiv (m^r)^s \equiv m^{rs} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
We can do this because $s$ is part of the <em><b>private key</b></em>. Note that in this case, we're dealing with a form of <em><b>asymmetric encryption</b></em>, since <b>anyone with the public key</b> can encrypt a message but <b>only the owner of the private key</b> can decrypt it. Everything makes sense up until the last implication. How does $m^{rs} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n)$?
</p>

<p>
We need a lemma.
</p>

<p><b><u>Lemma:</u></b> Let $n = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes. If $a$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$ and $w$ is an integer such that $w=1$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$, then 
\[
a^w \equiv a \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> <em>Left as an exercise to the reader.</em> 
</p>

<p>
Just kidding. This lemma is built off a powerful theorem, whose proof relies heavily on group theory. Since this post is getting rather long, I'll prove it in the next post, as well as shed some light on the intuition behind choosing the oddly specific number $(p-1)(q-1)$ for $s$ to be relatively prime to. Now that we have this lemma, the equivalence 
\[
m^{rs} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n) 
\]
follows from the fact that we defined $r$ to be the <em>multiplicative inverse </em> of $s$ (so $rs \equiv 1$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$), and the lemma above, setting $a$ equal to $m$ and $w$ equal to $rs$. 
</p>

<p>
And there we have it! Look out for part two, where I'll talk about digital signatures, group theory, and implementing this in real life.

<p>Here are some reasons why.</p>

<h3>The web is bloated</h3>

<p><strong>In a world of overdesigning and excessive emphasis on the graphical user experience, the internet has become massively bloated.</strong> How many times have you loaded up a website for it to look like <a href="pictures/bloated_wire.jpg" target="_blank">this?</a> <a href="http://everyfuckingwebsite.com" target="_blank">Or what about this?</a> (I don't condone swearing by the way).</p>

<p> Either way, "modern" websites have become an abomination. The original premise that websites should be distributed, accessible, and convey information effectively has been abandoned in favor of advertisements, bloat, and rampant censorship. 
</p>

<h3> Self-sufficiency on the Internet</h3>

<p>When I set out to create this website, I had two goals, the first of which was <strong>self-sufficiency.</strong> I own the VPS this is hosted on and set up the SSL certificate/nginx myself (with the help of some open source software). I write blog posts in HTML and upload them without the help of a static site generator. 
</p>

<p>Sure, I gain some functionality and save some time if I host my site with GitHub or use Wordpress as a backend for my blog. <em>However, that comes at the cost of full control over <strong>my</strong> website</em>. The miniscule time and cost investment is a small price to pay for <strong>actually owning your own things</strong> (Doesn't that sound ridiculous? Most people don't online).
</p>

<h3> Less is more </h3>

<p>My second goal was a design goal: KISS, or, <b>K</b>eep <b>I</b>t <b>S</b>imple, <b>S</b>my friend. I'm a minimalist. I don't like owning branded T-shirts or physical papers. I don't even own a mouse! It doesn't make sense for me to over-engineer a simple static text-based website. I only load what I need, and I don't abuse Javascript like Google (see: Google Docs protected mode. How does even exist??).
</p>

<p>If you're curious, <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1/website" target="_blank">check out the source code</a>— of course, open source is essential for digital freedom. In terms of design, I took inspiration from <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com target="_blank"">these</a> <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com" target="_blank">three</a> <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz" target="_blank">websites</a> (once again, I don't condone swearing). There's one more reason left as to why my website looks like this...

<h3> The final reason </h3>
<p>
I'm lazy and not very good at HTML/CSS.

<h2 id='topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction'>Topological Continuity: Simplicity in Abstraction</h2>
<small>[<a href='#topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Abstraction is often looked down upon by engineers and physicists as something mathematicians do to make life harder for themselves, obfuscate simple things, and make math less applicable in real life.</p> 
<p>However, the opposite is actually true— restricting your viewpoint to one set or space (say, \( \mathbb{R}^n \)) makes things much more complicated than they have to be. <strong>Beauty and simplicity lie in levels of abstraction.</strong> Let's take a look at an example, some prerequisites include basic knowledge of metric spaces and topological spaces. </p>

<p>Here's the standard rigorous definition of continuity from Real Analysis. We say \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is <b>continuous</b> at \( x_0 \in \mathbb{R} \) if for all \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that 

<p>
\[ 
    |x - x_0| < \delta \implies |f(x)-f(x_0)| < \epsilon 
\]
</p>

for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). Of course the domain doesn't have to be \( \mathbb{R} \), it can be any interval, say \( A \). When a function is continuous for all \( x_0 \in A \), it's <em>continuous on</em> \( A \). If a function is continuous on its domain, we just say it's <em>continuous</em>.
</p>

<p> That probably triggered some flashbacks for some poor Calculus students learning about limits for the first time (I too, feared the epsilon-delta dynamic duo up until I took Analysis). It doesn't have to be this scary! Forget the strange Greek letters, let's make this definition more powerful and simple at the same time.</p>

<p> Observe that the absolute value signs are just measuring the <em>distance</em> between two points in $\mathbb{R}$, indeed, this seems like a job more suited for <b>metric spaces</b>. Let $\mathbb{R}$ be equipped with the standard metric $d$ such that $d: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \, d(x,y) = |x-y|$. You can easily check that $d$ satisfies the conditions for a metric, so $(\mathbb{R},d)$ is a metric space. Now let's rewrite our previous definition in metric terms: \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is continuous at \( x_0 \in \mathbb{R} \) if for all \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that 

\[
    d(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d(f(x),f(x_0)) < \epsilon.
\]

<p>Recall the definition of an <em>open ball</em> in a metric space. Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, $x_0 \in X, \gamma \gt 0$. Then we define an <u>open ball</u> as 
\[ B(x_0, \gamma) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,x_0) < \gamma \}. \]
Intuitively, it's the set of all points a certain distance <em>gamma</em> away from another point $x_0$. Notice that the two expressions in the definition just refer to points $(x \in \mathbb{R})$ a certain positive distance $(\epsilon, \delta)$ away from another point $(x_0)$, hmmm...
\[
    d(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d(f(x),f(x_0)) < \epsilon
\]
implies that 
\[
    x \in B(x_0, \delta) \implies f(x) \in B(f(x_0), \epsilon)
\]
which subsequently implies
\[
    f\left[B(x_0, \delta) \right] \subset B(f(x_0),\epsilon).
\]
The last implication may seem somewhat arcane, but just look closer and you'll see it quickly follows from the definition of the image of a set under a function. But wait! We haven't even seen the final form of continuity yet! Recall that every metric space generates a topology, and that the metric topology is generated by defining open balls as open sets... Now we're ready to define the final layer of abstraction, topological continuity. 
</p>

<p><b><u>Definition:</u></b> Let $(X, \tau_x )$ and $(Y, \tau_y )$ be <em>topological spaces</em>. Then a function $f: X \to Y$ is <b>continuous</b> if for all open sets $H \in \tau_y, \, f^{-1}(H) \in \tau_x.$
</p>

<p>The moment of truth: we transformed a convoluted epsilon delta definition into a simple, elegant, and much more widely applicable statement: <em>"A function is <b>continuous</b> if the pre-image of an open set is open."</em> Not only is this statement much simpler, it also applies to all sorts of spaces— the set of binary sequences, a really long line, co-finite sets, anything. Isn't that great?
