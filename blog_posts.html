<h2 id='topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction'>Topological Continuity: Simplicity in Abstraction</h2>
<small>[<a href='#topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Abstraction is often looked down upon by engineers and physicists as something mathematicians do to make life harder for themselves, obfuscate simple things, and make math less applicable in real life.</p> 
<p>However, it's actually the opposite- restricting your viewpoint to one set or space (say, \( \mathbb{R}^n \)) makes things much more complicated than they have to be. <strong>Beauty and simplicity lie in levels of abstraction.</strong> Let's take a look at an example, some prerequisites include basic knowledge of metric spaces and topological spaces. </p>

<p>Here's the standard rigorous definition of continuity from Real Analysis. We say \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is <b>continuous</b> at \( x_0 \in \mathbb{R} \) if for all \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that 
<p>
\[ 
    |x - x_0| < \delta \implies |f(x)-f(x_0)| < \epsilon 
\]
</p>
for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). Of course the domain doesn't have to be \( \mathbb{R} \), it can be any interval, say \( A \). When a function is continuous for all \( x_0 \in A \), it's <em>continuous on</em> \( A \). If a function is continuous on its domain, we just say it's <em>continuous</em>.
