<h2 id='why-does-my-website-look-so-old'>Why does my website look so old?</h2>
<small>[<a href='#why-does-my-website-look-so-old'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/why-does-my-website-look-so-old.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Here are some reasons why.</p>

<h3>The web is bloated</h3>

<p><strong>In a world of overdesigning and excessive emphasis on the graphical user experience, the internet has become massively bloated.</strong> How many times have you loaded up a website for it to look like <a href="pictures/bloated_wire.jpg" target="_blank">this?</a> <a href="http://everyfuckingwebsite.com" target="_blank">Or what about this?</a> (I don't condone swearing by the way).</p>

<p> Either way, "modern" websites have become an abomination. The original premise that websites should be distributed, accessible, and convey information effectively has been abandoned in favor of advertisements, bloat, and rampant censorship. 
</p>

<h3> Self-sufficiency on the Internet</h3>

<p>When I set out to create this website, I had two goals, the first of which was <strong>self-sufficiency.</strong> I own the VPS this is hosted on and set up the SSL certificate/nginx myself (with the help of some open source software). I write blog posts in HTML and upload them without the help of a static site generator. 
</p>

<p>sure, i gain some functionality and save some time if i host my site with github or use wordpress as a backend for my blog. <em>however, that comes at the cost of full control over <strong>my</strong> website</em>. the miniscule time and cost investment is a small price to pay for <strong>actually owning your own things</strong> (doesn't that sound ridiculous? most people don't online).
</p>

<h3> Less is more </h3>

<p>My second goal was a design goal: KISS, or, <b>K</b>eep <b>I</b>t <b>S</b>imple, <b>S</b>my friend. I'm a minimalist. I don't like owning branded T-shirts or physical papers. I don't even own a mouse! It doesn't make sense for me to over-engineer a simple static text-based website. I only load what I need, and I don't abuse Javascript like Google (see: Google Docs protected mode. How does even exist??).
</p>

<p>If you're curious, <a href="https://github.com/simonxiang1/website" target="_blank">check out the source code</a>— of course, open source is essential for digital freedom. In terms of design, I took inspiration from <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com target="_blank"">these</a> <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com" target="_blank">three</a> <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz" target="_blank">websites</a> (once again, I don't condone swearing). There's one more reason left as to why my website looks like this...

<h3> The final reason </h3>
<p>
I'm lazy and not very good at HTML/CSS. Plus, it looks like your <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/" target="_blank">average math professor's website</a>. I think I have Stockholm syndrome— the plain HTML aesthetic has grown on me quite a bit. Also, it helps that Linux distributions default to a nice aesthetic font like <a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/" target="_blank">DejaVu</a> as opposed to whatever abomination I saw when I loaded my website on Windows. This is next-level "it works on my machine" right here. </p>

<h2 id='proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-1-asymmetric-encryption'>Proving RSA Encryption: An Application of Group Theory (Part 1: Asymmetric Encryption)</h2>
<small>[<a href='#proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-1-asymmetric-encryption'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/proving-rsa-encryption-an-application-of-group-theory-part-1-asymmetric-encryption.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
If someone receives an email from me, they might notice a peculiar "signature.asc" file attached at the bottom. This is not a bug— this is so the recipient can decrypt this file with the <b>RSA encryption algorithm</b> and verify that the sender is in fact, me, and the message has not been tampered with.
</p>

<p>
In essence, how the RSA algorithm works is by multiplying two very large prime numbers, known only to the recipient of the message, and making the product public (this is known as a <b><em>public key</em> </b>). The sender uses the product to encrypt a message using an algorithm that only someone with knowledge of the two prime numbers (known as the <b><em>private key</em></b>) can decrypt. We can leave the question of the computational difficulty of integer factorization, i.e., whether or not there exists an algorithm that factors large prime numbers in polynomial time, to the computer scientists (hopefully there isn't, or else a large portion of modern day encryption becomes useless). 
</p>

<p>
What we're concerned with, as mathematicians, is the <b>validity</b> of the algorithm. We want to know, given <b><em>any</em></b> message, will the recipient <b><em>always</em></b> be able to decrypt the encrypted message with their private key and get the right message? Let's get right into the math— all you'll need to be familiar with is some basic number theory.
</p>

<p><b><u>Definition:</u></b> Let $n$ be the product of two prime numbers $p$ and $q$ respectively, and $s$ be an integer relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$. Let $p, q,$ and $s$ be part of the <em><b>private key</b></em>, and let $n$ and $r$ be part of the <em><b>public key</b></em>, where $r$ is the <em>multiplicative inverse</em> of $s$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$. That is, $rs \equiv 1$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$.  
</p>

<p>
The definitions may seem a little strange and arbitrary— no worries! Everything will fall into place over time. For now, our goal is to show that, using the public and private keys, the sender and recipient can <em>successfully complete an <b>encryption/decryption exchange</b></em>. Let's define what that is real quick: in this case, let $m$ be the message being encrypted (Note that $m$ is an integer— there are several ways to encode messages as integers that we will not cover here for the sake of brevity).       
</p>

<p><b>Encryption:</b> Let $e$ equal the encrypted message, which is determined by 
\[
e \equiv m^r \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
This is simple since $n$ and $r$ are known, and a computer can easily perform modular exponentiation in polynomial time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Decryption:</b> After receiving the encrypted message $e$, we decrypt it by computing 
\[
e^s \equiv (m^r)^s \equiv m^{rs} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
We can do this because $s$ is part of the <em><b>private key</b></em>. Note that in this case, we're dealing with a form of <em><b>asymmetric encryption</b></em>, since <b>anyone with the public key</b> can encrypt a message but <b>only the owner of the private key</b> can decrypt it. Everything makes sense up until the last implication. How does $m^{rs} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n)$?
</p>

<p>
We need a lemma.
</p>

<p><b><u>Lemma:</u></b> Let $n = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes. If $a$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$ and $w$ is an integer such that $w=1$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$, then 
\[
a^w \equiv a \, (\text{mod} \, n).
\]
</p>
<p><b><u>Proof:</u></b> <em>Left as an exercise to the reader.</em> 
</p>

<p>
Just kidding. This lemma is built off a powerful theorem, whose proof relies heavily on group theory. Since this post is getting rather long, I'll prove it in the next post, as well as shed some light on the intuition behind choosing the oddly specific number $(p-1)(q-1)$ for $s$ to be relatively prime to. Now that we have this lemma, the equivalence 
\[
m^{rs} \equiv m \, (\text{mod} \, n) 
\]
follows from the fact that we defined $r$ to be the <em>multiplicative inverse </em> of $s$ (so $rs \equiv 1$ mod $(p-1)(q-1)$), and the lemma above, setting $a$ equal to $m$ and $w$ equal to $rs$. 
</p>

<p>
And there we have it! Look out for part two, where I'll talk about digital signatures, group theory, and implementing this in real life.

<h2 id='topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction'>Topological Continuity: Simplicity in Abstraction</h2>
<small>[<a href='#topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/topological-continuity-simplicity-in-abstraction.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Abstraction is often looked down upon by engineers and physicists as something mathematicians do to make life harder for themselves, obfuscate simple things, and make math less applicable in real life.</p> 
<p>However, the opposite is actually true— restricting your viewpoint to one set or space (say, \( \mathbb{R}^n \)) makes things much more complicated than they have to be. <strong>Beauty and simplicity lie in levels of abstraction.</strong> Let's take a look at an example, some prerequisites include basic knowledge of metric spaces and topological spaces. </p>

<p>Here's the standard rigorous definition of continuity from Real Analysis. We say \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is <b>continuous</b> at \( x_0 \in \mathbb{R} \) if for all \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that 

<p>
\[ 
    |x - x_0| < \delta \implies |f(x)-f(x_0)| < \epsilon 
\]
</p>

for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). Of course the domain doesn't have to be \( \mathbb{R} \), it can be any interval, say \( A \). When a function is continuous for all \( x_0 \in A \), it's <em>continuous on</em> \( A \). If a function is continuous on its domain, we just say it's <em>continuous</em>.
</p>

<p> That probably triggered some flashbacks for some poor Calculus students learning about limits for the first time (I too, feared the epsilon-delta dynamic duo up until I took Analysis). It doesn't have to be this scary! Forget the strange Greek letters, let's make this definition more powerful and simple at the same time.</p>

<p> Observe that the absolute value signs are just measuring the <em>distance</em> between two points in $\mathbb{R}$, indeed, this seems like a job more suited for <b>metric spaces</b>. Let $\mathbb{R}$ be equipped with the standard metric $d$ such that $d: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \, d(x,y) = |x-y|$. You can easily check that $d$ satisfies the conditions for a metric, so $(\mathbb{R},d)$ is a metric space. Now let's rewrite our previous definition in metric terms: \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is continuous at \( x_0 \in \mathbb{R} \) if for all \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that 

\[
    d(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d(f(x),f(x_0)) < \epsilon.
\]

<p>Recall the definition of an <em>open ball</em> in a metric space. Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, $x_0 \in X, \gamma \gt 0$. Then we define an <u>open ball</u> as $B(x_0, \gamma) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,x_0) < \gamma \}$. Intuitively, it's the set of all points a certain distance <em>gamma</em> away from another point $x_0$. Notice that the two expressions in the definition just refer to points ($x \in \mathbb{R}$) a certain positive distance (epsilon, delta) away from another point ($x_0$), hmmm...
\[
    d(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d(f(x),f(x_0)) < \epsilon
\]
implies that 
\[
    x \in B(x_0, \delta) \implies f(x) \in B(f(x_0), \epsilon)
\]
which subsequently implies
\[
    f\left[B(x_0, \delta) \right] \subset B(f(x_0),\epsilon).
\]
The last implication may seem somewhat arcane, but just look closer and you'll see it quickly follows from the definition of the image of a set under a function. But wait! We haven't even seen the final form of continuity yet! Recall that every metric space generates a topology, and that the metric topology is generated by defining open balls as open sets... Now we're ready to define the final layer of abstraction, topological continuity. 
</p>

<p><b><u>Definition:</u></b> Let $(X, \tau_x )$ and $(Y, \tau_y )$ be <em>topological spaces</em>. Then a function $f: X \to Y$ is <b>continuous</b> if for all open sets $H \in \tau_y, \, f^{-1}(H) \in \tau_x.$
</p>

<p>The moment of truth: we transformed a convoluted epsilon delta definition into a simple, elegant, and much more widely applicable statement: <em>"A function is <b>continuous</b> if the pre-image of an open set is open."</em> Not only is this statement much simpler, it also applies to all sorts of spaces— the set of binary sequences, a really long line, co-finite sets, anything. Isn't that great?
