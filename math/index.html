<h1>Math Resources</h1>

<p> I just had a lightbulb moment to put a list of my course work and other math related topics (like a collection of my math blog posts) here. Don't mind the construction sounds, this is still a work in progress. 
</p>

<h2>Coursework</h2>
Here is a list of all my coursework and lecture notes from school.
<h3>UT Austin</h3>
<h3>University of North Texas (TAMS)</h3>

<h2>Blog</h2>
A collection of the blog posts about mathematical topics.
<h3>Metamath</h3>
And some posts without any actual math about the topic of math itself.
