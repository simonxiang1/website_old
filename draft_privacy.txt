<strong>The web has become a product rather than a tool—</strong> most users only use a select number of top sites, essentially giving up any freedoms they had before to Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. Rather than everybody owning thier own small portion of the web, we have a small portion of corporations owning everyone— allowing them to track, suppress, and censor users to no end.
